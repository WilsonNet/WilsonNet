# Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello, I'm Wilson, I will try to talk about myself here and guide you through the mess that is my profile.

## Professional work

I have 2 years of experience as a Front-end developer and have done projects for companies that have a very large reach inside Brazil, like Britania, Philco, Positivo, Furukawa and others.



Unfortunately my professional work is kept in a private Gitlab server. It's not avaiable to showcase here.
