# Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello, I'm Wilson, I will try to talk about myself here and guide you through the mess that is my profile.

## Professional work

I have 2 years of experience as a front-end developer working for Nerdweb, in that timeframe I have done b2b projects for companies that have a very large reach inside Brazil, like Britânia, Philco, Positivo, Furukawa, and others. 

Unfortunately, my professional work is kept on a private Gitlab server. It's not available to showcase here, but some websites are public and still in production, so you can take a look.

### Public websites that I coded the front-end from scratch and are still in production.
- [Canova do Brasil](https://canovadobrasil.com.br/)
- [On The List](https://onthelist.com.br/)

### A few public websites that I've maintained
- [Caldo Bom](https://caldobom.com.br/)
- [Goodies Bakery](https://www.goodiesbakery.com.br/)
- [Vapza](https://www.vapza.com.br/)
- [Dia dos Pais Britânia](https://www.diadospaisbritania.com.br/)

## About my Github
Most of the stuff here is from tutorials that I follow along, there are very few projects that were made by me from scratch.

Some of them are:

https://github.com/WilsonNet/vento-aureo

A .io game that is currently under development. It's made using the Phaser 3 engine and Typescript.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/lp-softskills

A small landing page that was made for Rocketseat's "Expansion Week" event.

This is actually one of the first times that I've ever coded in my life. Before this, the only contact with JavaScript that I previously had was through exercises in the "Eloquent Javascript" book.
