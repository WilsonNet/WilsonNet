# Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello, I'm Wilson, hope you enjoy your stay!

## About my Github
Most of the stuff here is from tutorials that I follow along, there are very few projects that were made by me from scratch.

Some of them are:

https://github.com/WilsonNet/vento-aureo - An .io game that is currently under development. It's made using the Phaser 3 engine and Typescript

https://github.com/WilsonNet/lp-softskills - A small landing page that was made for Rocketseat's "Expansion Week" event.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/DoctorDolphin - The first time I coded outside of programming exercises, it was a JavaScript game for Global Game Jam Curitiba, we were a 6 person team that had 48 hours to spit out a game.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/nvimrc - You can also get my Neovim config here

This is actually one of the first times that I've ever coded in my life. Before this, the only contact with JavaScript that I previously had was through exercises in the "Eloquent Javascript" book.
