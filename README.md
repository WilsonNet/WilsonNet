# Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello, I'm Wilson, I will try to talk about myself here and guide you through the mess that is my profile.

## Professional work

I have 2 years of experience as a front-end developer working for Nerdweb, and have done b2b projects for companies that have a very large reach inside Brazil, like Britania, Philco, Positivo, Furukawa and others. 

Unfortunately my professional work is kept in a private Gitlab server. It's not avaiable to showcase here, but some websites are public and still in production, so you can take a look.

### Sites that I coded the front-end from scratch and are still in production.

- [Canova do Brasil](https://canovadobrasil.com.br/)
- [On The List](https://onthelist.com.br/)

### A few sites that I've mantained
- [Caldo Bom](https://caldobom.com.br/)
- [Goodies Bakery](https://www.goodiesbakery.com.br/)
- [Vapza](https://www.vapza.com.br/)
- [Dia dos Pais Brit√¢nia](https://www.diadospaisbritania.com.br/)

## About my Github
Most of stuff here are from tutorials that I follow along, there is very little projects that was made by me from scratch.

Some of them are:

A small landing page that was made for Rocketseat's "Expansion Week" event.

This is actually one of the first time that I've ever coded in my life. Before this the only contact with JavaScript that I prevoulsy had were through exercises in the "Eloquent Javascript" book.
