# Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello, I'm Wilson, hope you enjoy your stay!

## About my Github
Most of the stuff here is from tutorials that I follow along, there are very few projects that were made by me from scratch.

Some of them are:

https://github.com/WilsonNet/vento-aureo

A .io game that is currently under development. It's made using the Phaser 3 engine and Typescript.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/lp-softskills

A small landing page that was made for Rocketseat's "Expansion Week" event.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/DoctorDolphin

This is actually one of the first times that I've ever coded in my life. Before this, the only contact with JavaScript that I previously had was through exercises in the "Eloquent Javascript" book.


## Studying Right Now
- TypeScript
- Linux 
- Golang

## Hobbies outside coding

- Learning Japanese

- Practicing my musical instruments
