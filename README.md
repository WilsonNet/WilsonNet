# Welcome to my Github Profile

Hello, I'm Wilson, I will try to talk about myself here and guide you through the mess that is my profile.

## Professional work

I have 2 years of experience as a Front-end developer and have done projects for companies that have a very large reach inside Brazil, like Britania, Philco, Positivo, Furukawa and others. 

Unfortunately my professional work is kept in a private Gitlab server. It's not avaiable to showcase here.

## About my Github
Most of stuff here are from tutorials that I follow along, there is very little projects that was made by me from scratch.

Some of them are:

https://github.com/WilsonNet/vento-aureo

A .io game that is currently under development. It's made using the Phaser 3 engine and Typescript.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/lp-softskills

A small landing page that was made for Rocketseat's "Expansion Week" event.

https://github.com/WilsonNet/DoctorDolphin

This is actually one of the first time that I've ever coded in my life. Before this the only contact with JavaScript that I prevoulsy had were through exercises in the "Eloquent Javascript" book.


## Studying Right Now
